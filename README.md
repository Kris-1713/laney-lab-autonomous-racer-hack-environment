# Autonomous Deep Racer

**A gamified 3D training environment where humans teach an AI to race.**

Students drive a virtual car in a browser-based simulator. Every lap generates training data — camera frames, steering angles, speed. That data trains a shared neural network that learns to drive autonomously. The class watches the AI improve over time as more people drive.

> Built for Deep Learning 1 at Laney College. No coding experience required to contribute — just drive.

## Vision

The virtual training environment is **gamified, 3D, and multiplayer**:

- **3D Racing View** — Chase cam or cockpit cam, real-time driving with keyboard/gamepad/touch
- **2D Top-Down View** — Minimap showing full track layout, car position, racing line trace, and AI ghost car
- **Multiple Tracks** — Oval (beginner), S-curves, city circuit, obstacle course, night mode
- **Dashboard** — Personal stats, class leaderboard, model performance over time, training status
- **Gamification** — XP per lap, achievements/badges, daily challenges, ghost racing vs the AI
- **Data Pipeline** — Every lap feeds the ML training loop automatically

The goal: make data collection feel like playing a game, not doing homework.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)

- Simulator manual driving + autonomous AI mode are implemented
- Forward-facing AI camera capture + local run export are implemented
- Shared Runs API is implemented and deployed (team data collection works)
- Trainer worker is implemented and deployed (PyTorch training + ONNX export)
- Simulator browser ONNX inference is implemented (active/pinned model selection, waypoint fallback)
- Physical racer runtime service foundation exists (`services/vehicle-runtime`) with ONNX inference + safety loop in mock/OpenCV modes

## How It Works

```
Drive the car  →  Data captured  →  Model trains  →  AI drives  →  Measure improvement
     ↑                                                                       |
     └─────────────────────── drive more to improve ←──────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **You drive** the car manually in the simulator
2. **Frames + controls** are recorded as training data
3. **A model trains** on accumulated data from the whole class
4. **The AI drives** autonomously — you can watch or race against it
5. **Metrics improve** as the dataset grows: faster laps, fewer crashes, smoother steering

## What You'll Learn

| Concept | How You Experience It |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Your driving demonstrations become labeled training data |
| **Neural Networks** | The model learns steering from camera images |
| **Dataset Construction** | The class collectively builds the dataset by driving |
| **Train / Evaluate / Iterate** | Watch the model improve with each training cycle |
| **Overfitting & Generalization** | See how the model handles tracks it wasn't trained on |
| **Sim-to-Real Transfer** | Models trained here deploy to a physical DeepRacer vehicle |

---

## For All Experience Levels

- **No coding experience** — Drive the simulator, review dashboards, give feedback. Your laps are just as valuable as anyone else's.
- **Some experience** — Help with data pipelines, reward functions, testing and evaluation.
- **Advanced** — Model architecture, training infrastructure, sim-to-real deployment, obstacle detection.

## Simulator Features (Planned)

### 3D Racing View
- React Three Fiber (Three.js) in the browser
- Chase cam / cockpit cam toggle
- Real-time steering via keyboard, gamepad, or touch
- Speed gauge, lap timer, racing line overlay
- Camera frame capture at ~10 FPS for training data (implemented locally with zip export)

### 2D Top-Down Minimap
- Always-visible canvas overlay
- Full track layout with car position + heading
- Racing line trace (where you've driven)
